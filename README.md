Facial Expression Recognition using tensorflow on the FER2013 dataset using convolutional networks. Both the deeper and shallow networks were trained on the cpu.

# Updates
The shallow_train is the one with only a few layers got about 50% as stated above. The ipython notebook has a deeper net with dropout. That one got about 55%.
